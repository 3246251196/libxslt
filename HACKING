         Rules for commits on the libxslt module
         =======================================

If what you are patching is a non-compilation issue either at compile
time or linking time on one of the main Linux platforms, then feel free
to patch first and send mail afterward, as long as it's a 'small fix'.

Otherwise, oly Bjorn Reese (breese@users.sourceforge.net) and me
(veillard@redhat.com) should commit there. Send a mail and if it's a
bug issue, register it at bugzilla.gnome.org in the libxslt module.
I check both my mail and the bug database on a very regular basis.
if you don't get an answer within a week (which is highly unprobable)
then commit your changes. This simply mean that I'm on holliday or
on the road.

  thanks in advance for following the rule,

Daniel
